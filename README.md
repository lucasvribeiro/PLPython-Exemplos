# PL / Python
This repository contains examples of using PL/Python in PostgreSQL.

#### About
The examples contained in this repository were developed by Lucas Vinicius Ribeiro and Lucas Souza Santos, students of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the Federal Technological University of Paraná - Campo Mourão campus (UTFPR-CM). Such examples were developed in the semester 2018/2, for the final work of the discipline of Database 2, taught by professor André Luiz Schwerz, from the Computing Department of UTFPR-CM (DACOM).

[In this](https://github.com/lucasvribeiro/PLPython-Exemplos/blob/master/Artigo%20Final/PL_Python_Artigo.pdf) work, we will give a brief introduction about the Python programming language and also about PostgreSQL. Next, we'll focus on explaining how to install and use PL/Python. 

In addition, we will give some practical examples of how it works, and list some of the advantages and disadvantages of using PL / Python.
All sample files used in the work in question are available in this repository.
